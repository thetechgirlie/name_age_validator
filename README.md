# Name-Age-Validator

This is a basic Dart program I created while learning the language. It validates user input for **name** (letters only) and **age** (numbers only), continuously prompting the user until valid entries are provided. Once valid inputs are entered, the program greets the user with their name and confirms their age.

## Features
- **Name Validation**: Ensures the name contains only alphabetic characters.
- **Age Validation**: Ensures the age is a valid number.
- **User Interaction**: Prompts users until valid input is provided.

## How to Run

1. Install Dart on your machine: [Install Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/name-age-validator.git
